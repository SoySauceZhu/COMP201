## Software Process

## Software Process
- Life cycle: the process involves the building of a product. 
- For a software, its life cycle terminates when the provider stops support. 

## Software Process Model (Development Patter)

#### Waterfall Model
- A stepwise refinement of requirement.

- Suitable when the requirement is well-determined and understood.

- Drawback: 
    - inflexible partitioning of project
    - difficult to update
    - It describes a process of stepwise refinement of the requirement

### Evolutionary Development
- Develop software form a initial implementation, then refine (add new features) it based on user's response.
- Evolutionary development involves **Exploratory** development. (Exploratory $\in$ Evolutionary)
    - Exploratory development starts with a well-understood requirement
    - The system evolves by adding new features

- Drawbacks:
    - Lack of process visibility
    - Sometimes poorly structured
    - Not suitable in safety critical projects

### Agile and Scrum
- Lightweight approach to software development
- Test driven development
- Pair programming
- Scrum: Incremental Development
    - Development and delivery is broken down into increments (*sprints*) that gives part of the functionality
    - High priority requirement are included in early increments
    - once the development of an increment is started, the requirements are frozen through requirements, so that later increment can continue to evolve.
 
**Advantage**

- Customers' value can be delivered with each increment, so system functionality is avaiable earlier.
- early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increment.
- lower risk of overall project failure
- the highest priority functions tend to receive more testing.

## Summary
- iterative process models describe the software process as a cycle of activities
-  generic process models describe the organisation of software processes
-   general activities are: specific specification design and implementation, validation and evolution
- software process at the activities involved in producing and evolving a software system there were represented in a software process model
