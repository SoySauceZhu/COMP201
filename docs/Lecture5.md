# Use case analysis
## Recap of requirement
- Requirement can be functional
    - Defines what the system should do
-  requirements can be non-functional
    - Defies the trends are higher the functions are provided.

## Use case and User stories
- User stories are less formal and simpler to define than use cases, This is widely used in agile Development.

- Use cases are a scenario based technique in the UML which identify the actors in an interaction, and which describe the interaction itself.
    - All possible interaction with the system should be involved in use cases
    - Sequence diagram may be used to add details to use cases by showing the sequence of event processing in the system.

## Use case
- Actor
    - can be human can be non-human
- Use case: In a use case diagram, Use case is the task which the actor needs to perform with the help of system

The details of each use case should also be documented by a used case description

## Include and extend
- Include
    - Always invoking
- Extend
    - Optional invoking

## Note
- Use cases do not describe internal behaviors
- They must describe behaviors with external actors
- And always involve external behaviors
